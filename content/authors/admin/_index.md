I am currently a MS student in economics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am applying for ECON PhD Programs. Hope everything can go well. I like distance running and have taken running as a very imporatant part of my life. Because it can not only give me peace, but also expel anxiety and pressure. Let's run!
